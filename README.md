## Key Insights & Visual Analysis  

### **1. Why Did November 2017 Have the Highest Sales?**

**Key Insight:**  
- **November 2017 had the highest recorded sales (R$1,177,298.47)**, significantly outperforming other months.  
- This peak **aligns with Black Friday promotions**, indicating that **discounts and promotional campaigns played a major role in driving revenue**.  

**November 2017 Sales Analysis**  
![November Sales](nov_sales.png)  

**Potential Factors Behind November 2017’s Sales Peak:**  
- **Black Friday Influence** – Heavy discounts attracted more buyers.  
- **Holiday Season Kick-Off** – Early Christmas shopping boosted purchases.  
- **Higher Conversion Rates** – Promotions and urgency likely improved checkouts.  
- **Marketing & Campaign Timing** – Pre-Black Friday campaigns played a key role.  

**Strategies to Increase Sales in Other Months:**  
- **Replicate Black Friday Promotions in Other Shopping Seasons** –  
  - Focus on **May (Mother’s Day), August (Back-to-School), and December (Christmas)**.  
- **Leverage AI for Dynamic Pricing Optimisation** –  
  - Implement **real-time price elasticity models** to adjust pricing based on demand.  
- **Enhance Product Bundling & Upselling Techniques** –  
  - Use **Market Basket Analysis** to recommend complementary products.  

**Monthly Contribution Breakdown**  
![Monthly Contribution](monthly_contribution.png)  

**Observation:**  
- **May and August also demonstrated strong sales contributions**, requiring further marketing efforts.  
- **February saw unexpected spikes**, possibly from **Valentine’s Day promotions**.

### **2. Seasonal Sales Trends & Opportunities**

**Key Insight:**  
- **Q4 consistently outperforms other quarters**, highlighting seasonal demand surges.  
- **Sales drop by ~50% in Spring & Summer**, signalling missed revenue opportunities.  

**Sales Performance by Quarter**

**Strategic Enhancements:**  
- **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting** – Use **Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM neural networks** for optimised predictions.  
- **Extend Seasonal Campaigns to Spring & Summer** – Counteract the decline in these periods with promotional events.  
- **Pre-Holiday Engagement Strategies** – Implement **email marketing and targeted ads** before high-demand months.

### **3. Forecasting Challenges & Improvements**

**Key Issue:**  
- The **Prophet model produced unreliable forecasts** with **sharp spikes and sudden declines**.  
- **Post-2018 sales drop-off suggests missing data issues** affecting long-term trends.  

**Sales Forecasting Trends**

**Total Sales Forecast for Next Quarter**  
![Sales Forecast Next Quarter](sales_forecast_next_quarter.png)  

**Why Prophet Performed Poorly:**  
- **Overfitting to Noise** – Prophet is **sensitive to missing data and outliers**, distorting trend detection.  
- **No External Variables Considered** – Prophet lacks the ability to factor in **marketing campaigns, competitor pricing, and economic trends**.  
- **Missing Data Post-2018** – This weakened the model’s ability to detect recurring seasonality.  

**Better Forecasting Models for Future Analysis:**  
- **SARIMA for Improved Seasonality Handling**  
- **LSTM (Deep Learning) for Detecting Long-Term Trends**  
- **XGBoost for Event-Based Demand Forecasting**

### **4. Customer Retention Challenges**

**Key Issue:**  
- **Customer return rate is critically low at 1.02%**, compared to **27% (Shopify industry benchmark)**.  
- Olist **relies too heavily on first-time buyers**, rather than cultivating repeat purchases.  

**Retention Challenges**

**Strategic Actions to Improve Retention:**  
- **Implement Loyalty Programmes & Personalised Discounts**  
- **Leverage AI-Powered Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)**  
- **Enhance Post-Purchase Engagement via Targeted Emails**
